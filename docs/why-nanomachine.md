# Why Nanomachine?

## Benefits

## Comparisons

### XState

Nanomachine is a <u>**more lightweight**</u> state machine library compared to XState, it has a <u>**perfect typing system**</u> that ensures type safety, and it offers <u>**better file splitting**</u> capabilities for modular code organization. Overall, Nanomachine provides a <u>**more ergonomic API**</u> that enhances developer experience and productivity.

However, XState is way *(waaaaay)* more popular and has a larger community. It is more battle-tested and has more integrations with other libraries and frameworks. 

If you need a more robust solution with a larger ecosystem, XState might be the better choice. But if you prefer writing ergonomic and type-safe code, Nanomachine is the way to go.

> [!NOTE]
> XState was my inspiration to create Nanomachine. I created Nanomachine to address the typing issues I encountered while using XState in my projects, but without it, Nanomachine would not exist. So all credits to [David Khourshid](https://x.com/davidkpiano), [Mateusz Burzy≈Ñski](https://x.com/AndaristRake), and the entire XState team for their amazing work on XState.
